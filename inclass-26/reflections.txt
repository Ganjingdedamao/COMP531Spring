What did you hope to learn but did not?
I think I do learn quite a lot of thing in this course. I love this course.

What did you really enjoy learning about?
I really enjoy learning the idea of react, because using react divide the concerns and make life easier.

What worked well in the course? and how?
I think the materials provided in this course are great. Most materials are tightly related.
I learn a lot about the frontend and backend, and how to connect them. 
And also test driven development learning helps me to build a good habit to develop web application.

What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
I think the course schedule is a little bit tight. That helps me improve my study ability. However, it sometimes
drives me crazy. Maybe you can give more time for inclass exercise.

What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class
exercises, goals of projects â€“ and be specific please!
I think that the game assignment is not relevant to other assignment. I think maybe it is ok to remove it or 
replace it by some other related assignment, or make it a more complex assignment so that 
we can learn more about HTML5 game development in it.

Anything else you like to say?
Finally, thank you so much for giving us such wonderful course! I really appreciate your help in this course.
Thank you Scott.
